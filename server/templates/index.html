<p><span>Welcome to my site</span>
<p>My name is Joshua Seims, and I live in San Francisco.
<p>I'm a hacker, entrepreneur, and angel investor.
<p>I love building products that tease interesting patterns out of the world, and creating novel user experiences.
<p>Looking for help on your project?  Then get in touch.  I particularly enjoy advising early stage startups.

<h3>Projects</h3>

Here's a sampling of some recent side projects:

    <li><a href="/blog/im-almost-there/">I'm Almost There</a>.  An iPhone app that shows people where you are on a map as you're running late (or, conversely, get them to show you where they are as you're waiting for them).</li>
    <li><a href="fun_pics">Reddit Image Viewer</a>.  Easily view pictures added to Reddit as a nearly infinite stream.  Also, share this stream with your friends.</li>

<h3>Collaborate</h3>
<p>Creating a startup is an exhilarating experience.  I know, I've done it, and I've made almost every mistake in the process.  

<p>But I got enough things right to bootstrap a new business and grow it organically to over $20 million in annual revenue.

<p>
I enjoy helping people who are passionate about an idea and willing to knock down any obstacle to make their vision a reality.
